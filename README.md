Here are the confirmed working config files for an Ender3 with 4.2.7 controller and ABL ( using the 5 pin probe port) 

The easiest way tio use these files is

Download and install VS code

In VS code install platform IO  pluggin.

Again in VS code, install Marlin Auto build pluggin .

Download and unzip Marlin 2.1.1 

Compile the basic Marlin firmware "as is"  ( TO confirm you have VS code and pluggins working)

In the Marlin folder copy in the config files found here.

Re-compile the firmware then upload the bin file to the printer.

At first boot be sure to initialise the new firmware ( load settings M502) then save settings ( M500) or load and save using LCD menu options
